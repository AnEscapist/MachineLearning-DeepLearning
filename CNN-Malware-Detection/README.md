# Convolutional Neural Network and Malware Detection With CNN
## CNN-Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning approach to tackle the image classification problem, or what we call computer vision problems, because classic computer programs face many challenges and difficulties to identify objects for many reasons, including lighting, viewpoint, deformation and segmentation.

This technique is inspired by how the eye works, especially the visual cortex function algorighm in animals. CNNs are arranged in three-dimensional structures with width, height, and depth as characteristics. In the case of images, the height is the image height, the width is the image width, and the depth is RGB channels.

To build a CNN, we need three main types of layers:

**Convolutional layer:** A convolutional operation refers to extracting features from the input image and multiplying the values in the filter with the original pixel values.

**Pooling layer:** The pooling operation reduces the dimensionality of each feature map.

**Fully-connected layer:** The fully connected layer is a classic multi-layer perceptrons with a softmax activation function in the output layer.

## Understanding of CNN

CNN image classifications takes an input image, process it and classify it under certain categories (e.g. dog, cat, tiger, lion, etc.). Computers see an image as array of pixels and it depends on the image resolution. Based on the image resolution, it will see h * w * d (h = height, w = width, d = dimension). For example, an image of 6 * 6 * 3 array of matrix represents a RGB (3 refers to RGB values) image and an image of 4 * 4 * 1 array of matrix is a grayscale image.
